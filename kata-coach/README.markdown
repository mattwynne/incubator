# KataCoach

KataCoach helps make you a better programmer by forcing you to practice problems until you are so good at solving them you could perform your solution in front of a live audience.

The idea is simple. Download an open-source KataCoach-enabled kata, like the minesweeper kata, and fire up the coach.

You will be presented with the first failing acceptance test. KataCoach will give you five minutes to make the test pass. If the test is not passing at the end of the five minutes, your changes will be rolled back and you will have to start again.

As soon as the tests are passing, you will be presented with the next failing acceptance test. Again, you will have five minutes to make all the tests pass.
